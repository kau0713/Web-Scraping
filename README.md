# Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

This project focuses on web scraping using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to extract valuable information from web pages. The data was scraped from Project Gutenberg's Top 100 books page, where book titles and file numbers were retrieved. Using the `requests` library, we sent HTTP requests to fetch the webpage, and `BeautifulSoup` was used to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. Regular expressions were then employed to clean and organize the data, focusing on the titles of the books and their corresponding file numbers.

The key objective of this project was to automate the process of data extraction from a webpage, enabling the collection of large amounts of structured data with minimal manual effort. This exercise demonstrates the utility of web scraping for applications such as data collection for analysis, research, or further manipulation in a structured format.

The tools and libraries used include Python for general scripting, `requests` for retrieving the webpage content, and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing and navigating through the HTML structure. The use of regular expressions allowed for the precise extraction of book IDs and titles. The project can be run by executing
