# Web-Scraping-API-Integration

This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, API integration, and data visualization using Python. The first section involves scraping data from Project Gutenbergâ€™s Top 100 books page. Using libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup, the web scraping process retrieves book details like titles and file numbers, which are then cleaned and processed using regular expressions. The project highlights how to automate the extraction of valuable information from web pages and manage the resulting data.

The second part of the project focuses on integrating with external APIs. Using the OMDb API, a movie database, I developed functions that retrieve detailed movie data such as title, year, genre, and director based on user input. Additionally, the project includes functionality for downloading movie posters. Furthermore, I used the Weather API to retrieve real-time weather data for a specific city (Portland), demonstrating how to pull and parse JSON responses from an external API.

Finally, the project explores data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Using a dataset of Netflix users, I created visualizations such as bar graphs, pie charts, and density plots to display subscription types, gender distribution, and age distribution, respectively. These visualizations offer insights into user demographics and subscription behavior.

The skills demonstrated in this project include web scraping, API integration, data cleaning, and visualization using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project provides a comprehensive exploration of extracting, processing, and visualizing data from multiple sources.
